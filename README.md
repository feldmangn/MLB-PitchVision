# MLB-PitchVision
A computer vision project for fine-grained baseball pitch and activity recognition using the MLB-YouTube dataset


This repository reproduces and extends the analysis from "Fine-grained Activity Recognition in Baseball Videos" (CVPRW 2018), applying deep learning techniques to classify baseball actions such as pitch types and outcomes from broadcast video. Leveraging PyTorch and the publicly available MLB-YouTube dataset, the project includes:

Data preprocessing & video segmentation for model input

3D Inflated Convolutional Network (I3D) implementation for activity recognition

Model training and evaluation to benchmark against published results

Extensions: custom pitch-type classifier, player detection with YOLO, and pose estimation for biomechanical analysis

This work demonstrates transferable skills in image classification, temporal modeling, and segmentation that can be applied to sports analytics, biomedical imaging, and other video analysis domains.
